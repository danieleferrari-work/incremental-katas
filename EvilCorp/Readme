Welcome to Evil Corp. We deliver premium quality evil-tech for all dictators and
villains alike. You are the new developer for our censoring unit.

Our latest project is a test project of one of our previous products, but this time
it will be delivered in increments. We do this to practice the Agile Methodology,
so that we can deliver evil early, and adapt so we deliver the most valuable evil.

For the first delivery, we should be able to censor a word in a text.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, if the word 'nice' is blacklisted, our customer would expect the input
text 'You are a nice person' to become 'You are a XXXX person'.



STEP 2

The first delivery went well, and your product owner will join you later today.
Later that day.
Mr E.Vil enters the room.
- "The delivery proved to be solid and now we need to support the ability of
   blacklisting several words.
   It could be a very long list of words"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, if nice, pony, sun, light, fun, happy, funny, joy, and others are 
blacklisted words, the sentence 
    "Such a nice day with a bright sun, makes me happy"
becomes
    "Such a XXXX day with a bright XXX, makes me XXXXX"


STEP 3

Mr E.Vil approaches you.
- "Another solid delivery with the list of blacklisted words.
   All our tests passed and performance looked ok.

   Next, we should be able to match with other competitors out
   in the field. A very popular feature is to replace the whole
   word which the blacklisted word is a prefix of.

   Thus, if we have blacklisted 'friend', the sentence, 
     You are so friendly!
   Would become
     You are so XXXXXXXXX
  "
 
 STEP 4
 
 Mr E.Vil enters the room.
- "This project is going well!
   The Vice Precident - M.U.Haha is really pleased 
   with the results.

   Next, we have a great market waiting to pay us well,
   if we can give them the ability to replace unwanted
   words by other words.

   For example - assume the following replacements are
   defined

    bad -> ungood    
    better -> gooder 
    objection -> thoughtcrime
    agree -> crimestop

   Thus, the following sentence 

     'Objection is bad, a better thing to do, is to agree.'

   becomes

    'Thoughtcrime is ungood, a gooder thing to do, is to crimestop.'
  
   can you add this functionality?
   "

You get going, but with a nagging feeling that something
bad will come of this in the long run.
